# Portfolio Website

This is an assignment for CA09 AUT20 Data Analytics for Finance. 

## Information about the project instruction
Besides having a Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. accounts, this project is about building your own presence in the web where you tell the world who you are and show them examples of your work.

Building your own online presence is useful for a number of reasons, such as

1. It is useful for recruiting purposes, as you can easily point someone to your portfolio website
2. You participate in the wider data science/ R community
3. It builds discipline of working on your code and making sure it is reproducible, easy to understand, and share
4. You learn how to use Github along the way

You do not have to know much about HTML, you just have to invest some time on learning how to set up an account/repo at and working with Github, learning how the `blogdown` package works with Hugo, and link everything to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
